  "sample_voice_transcript": "Interviewer: So tell me about the business — how long have you been running it?\n\nFounder: We have been running for about 12 years now. My father started it in 2012 — precision engineering parts, mainly for the auto sector. I joined after my MBA about 5 years back. We are doing about 4 crore in revenue now, margins are decent, somewhere around 14 percent.\n\nInterviewer: And why are you looking to exit?\n\nFounder: Honestly? I have two younger brothers and they are not interested in the business at all. They are both in IT jobs in Pune. My father is getting older — he is 68 — and I am the one running everything. But I want to do something in the tech space. I have this SaaS idea I have been sitting on for almost 2 years now. I just cannot do both. The shop needs full attention.\n\nInterviewer: What is your timeline?\n\nFounder: Ideally within 6 months? We are not in financial trouble or anything. Revenue is stable, we have great relationships with Tata Motors and Mahindra — they have been with us for over 8 years. But I want to move fast. If someone gives me a fair price, I will take it. I am not looking for the absolute maximum — I just want closure and to move on with my life.\n\nInterviewer: Any other stakeholders involved in the decision?\n\nFounder: My father holds 70 percent and I have 30. He is actually supportive of the sale — he is tired too. He says he built this for the next generation, but if the next generation doesn't want it, better to sell to someone who does. So you would need to sit with both of us, but we are aligned. My brothers have no stake.\n\nInterviewer: What price range are you thinking?\n\nFounder: We have not done a formal valuation. Based on what I have read online — maybe 6 to 7 times EBITDA? Our EBITDA is roughly 56 lakhs. So I am thinking somewhere between 3 to 4 crore. I am flexible honestly. If the right buyer comes along and they are genuine, I would rather close at 3 crore and be done than wait 2 years for 4 crore."
